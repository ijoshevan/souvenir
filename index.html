   <h2>1. Understand Cultural Significance</h2>
<p>In Taipei, certain gifts carry specific meanings and implications. For instance, items such as clocks, shoes, and umbrellas are often associated with negative connotations, such as separation or bad luck.

This approach not only enhances the value of the gift but also strengthens your relationship with the recipient.</p>

<h2>3. Presentation is Key</h2>
<p>In Taiwanese culture, the way a gift is presented is just as important as the gift itself. Always present and receive gifts with both hands as a sign of respect. Additionally, it is customary to refuse a gift a few times before ultimately accepting it. This practice reflects humility and gratitude, making the exchange more meaningful.</p>

<h2>4. Timing and Occasion</h2>
